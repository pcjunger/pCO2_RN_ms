## About this manuscript:
The role of tropical lakes and reservoirs in the global carbon cycle has received increasing attention over the past decade, but our understanding of the temporal and spatial variability in their carbon balance is still limited. The metabolism of tropical systems may differ profoundly from temperate systems, due to higher temperatures and larger variations in precipitation. Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of variability of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and its drivers in a set of 102 low-latitude lakes and reservoirs that encompass wide gradients of precipitation, productivity and landscape properties (i.e., lake area, perimeter-to-area ratio, catchment size, catchment area-to-lake area ratio and types of catchment land use). We used simple and multiple regressions to determine the main in-lake variables driving pCO2 variance, and whether and how these internal variables were related to external landscape properties.
