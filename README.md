## About this manuscript:
The role of tropical lakes and reservoirs in the global carbon cycle has received increasing attention in the past decade, but our understanding of their variability is still limited. The metabolism of tropical systems may differ profoundly from temperate systems due to the higher temperatures and wider variations in precipitation. Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of the variability in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and its drivers in a set of 102 low-latitude lakes and reservoirs that encompass wide gradients of precipitation, productivity and landscape properties (lake area, perimeter-to-area ratio, catchment size, catchment area-to-lake area ratio, and types of catchment land use). We used multiple regressions and structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine the direct and indirect effects of the main in-lake variables and landscape properties on the water pCO2 variance.

## This repo includes:
This repo contains the R scripts and raw data used to run the analysis and figures presented in the manuscript "Effects of Seasonality, Trophic State and Landscape Properties on CO2 saturation in Low-Latitude Lakes and Reservoirs" published online in the journal *Science of the Total Environment* (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.273)
